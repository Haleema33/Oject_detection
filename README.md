## Overview

Object detection is a computer vision technique used to identify and locate objects in images or videos. This repository provides implementation examples using popular deep learning frameworks.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing scripts
- Model architecture for object detection
- Training and evaluation pipeline
- Visualization of detection results
- Support for custom datasets


## Dataset

You can use standard datasets like COCO, Pascal VOC, or your own custom dataset. Ensure images and annotations follow the expected format.

## Results

After training, detection results and performance metrics will be saved in the `results/` directory. Sample visualizations are provided.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request for improvements, bug fixes, or new features.
